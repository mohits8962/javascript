// What are the drawbacks of callback and what is callback hell.
// Answer- The biggest problem with callbacks is that they can not scale well and when we use too many callbacks it's very hard to read and debug and very hard to maintain.
// One of the major drawbacks of using callback functions is that they can lead to "callback hell", which is a situation where the code becomes deeply nested and difficult to read. And every callback depends on the previous callbacks. In this we don't have the control and confirmation of our function to call.
// This can be avoided by using functions such as Promise, which provide a way to handle async operations in a cleaner and more organized manner.
