// Strict Mode allows us to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The statement “use strict” tells the browser to use the Strict mode, which is a safer feature set of JavaScript.

// Benefits of using ‘use strict’:
// Strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors 
// Strict mode fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations
// It prevents, or throws errors, when “unsafe” actions are taken
// Strict mode makes it easier to write “secure” JavaScript.

// // Whole-script strict mode syntax
// 'use strict';
