// ECMAScript 6 (ES6) is a version of the ECMAScript standard, which is a scripting language that is widely used for web development. It is a modern version of JavaScript that includes many new features and improvements. Some of the notable features of ES6 include:

// 1- Arrow functions: Arrow functions are a shorthand syntax for writing function expressions. They have a shorter syntax than regular functions and do not have their own value.

// 2- Classes: ES6 introduces a class syntax for defining classes, which provides a more intuitive and familiar syntax for object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

// 3- Modules: ES6 introduces an import and export syntax for working with modules, which makes it easier to split your code into smaller, reusable pieces.

// 4- Template literals: Template literals are string literals that allow for embedded expressions. They are denoted with backticks (`) and can include placeholders for expressions, which are denoted with ${expression}.

// 5- Destructuring: Destructuring is a feature that allows you to extract values from arrays or objects into variables. It makes it easier to work with data structures by allowing you to extract only the values that you need.

// 6- Promises: Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, and they were introduced in ES6.

// There are many more, and the standard continues to evolve with the release of new versions.
