// ternary operator / conditional operator 
// This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.

// The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.

// let age = 3;
// let drink = age >= 5 ? "coffee" : "milk";
// console.log(drink);
